# Notes for "Algorithmic Thinking" from Rice University's 'The Fundamental of Computing'.

###1.1 Definition:
#####Algorithmic thinking is a problem solving process involving 5 steps:
	1. Understanding the problem - ask what is the problem, what sort of data available, and what outcomes are expected.
	2. Formulate the problem - express the problem using maths, so to make it comprehensible to the computer. Also formally define inputs and outputs. 
	3. Devolop an Algorithm - to solve the problem in theory. i.e. producing correct outputs when given inputs.
	4. Implementing the algo - have to consider feasibility, complexities, efficiency..etc
	5. Feed the inputs to the algo and answer the original questions.
