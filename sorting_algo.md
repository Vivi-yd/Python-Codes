3. repeat until no element on the left is greater than those on the right.


###Selection sort:
1. sorting the list by dividing it to 2 portion, the sorted and the unsorted. 
2. in each iteration, look for the minimum in the unsorted list and place it at the end of the sorted portion,
3. repeat until sorting complete.


###Insertion sort:
1. sorting the list by dividing into 2 portions, sorted and unsorted
2. insert each element of the unsorted portion into the appropraite
   postion of the sorted portion until the list is completely sorted.
